# Descend to Earth

This is a technical blog recording various fun things to do with Urbit
and [Solri](https://zod.that.world/giveaway). The blog itself is
hosted on Solri -- a peer-to-peer network of personal servers, and you
can always find me on the [Solri](https://zod.that.world/giveaway)
galaxy **~zod**.
