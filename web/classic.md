# Classic in Orbit

This is a blog mainly about Ethereum Classic. I write down ideas and
progress about Ethereum Classic development. The blog itself is hosted
on Solri -- a peer-to-peer network of personal servers, and you can
always find me on the [Solri](https://zod.that.world/giveaway) galaxy
**~zod**.
